# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
Built a simple artificial neural network to predict whether bank clients will leave or remain. Included data preprocessing, ANN architecture design, training, and performance evaluation.

## Workflow
- Data preprocessing: categorical encoding, train/test split, feature scaling  
- ANN built with TensorFlow/Keras (Sequential API, Dense layers)  
- Training with Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss  
- Evaluation using accuracy score and confusion matrix  

## Tools
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
